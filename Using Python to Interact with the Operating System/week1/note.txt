OPERATING SYSTEM:
The Software that manages everything that goes on in the computer

There are actually two main parts:

1) Kernel (It talks directly to hardware and manage our system resources)---- > System's resources ---> Disk ---> Memory ---> Network
 "As user we don't interact with the kernel directly"

2) User Space
"The user space is basically outside the kernel"
